Due to American Copyright Law, I cannot and will not distribute the neccessary ROMs of software/games.

From wherever you download them, only .bin files will work as its the raw data.

I will however list the neccessary ROMs per offered system.
  Apple I:
    Woz Monitor (256B)
    Woz Basic (4KB)

  Atari 2600:
    Any Atari 2600 game ROM should work (4KB-8KB)
